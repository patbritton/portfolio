# Hello World

This is my first update. I just deployed a **Twins Analytics Dashboard** using React and Recharts.

### Why this stack?
I wanted performance. By using Astro, I can ship zero JavaScript for the text, but hydrate the React charts instantly.

Check out the [Twins Dashboard](/projects/twins).
